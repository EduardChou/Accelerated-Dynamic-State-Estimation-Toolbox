# Accelerated Dynamic State Estimation Toolbox

This project is derived from **Research on Power System Dynamic State Estimation Based on Heterogeneous Computing Acceleration**, which is a Student Research Training Program (SRTP) project from ZJU. The project is based on the MATLAB project [Dynamic-State-Estimation-Toolbox-DSET-](https://github.com/JunjianQi/Dynamic-State-Estimation-Toolbox-DSET-), and is implemented in Python.
